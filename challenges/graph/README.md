# Graphs
**Graph (none-linear Data Structure)**

## Challenge
**Graph is a non-linear data structure type and commonly used in the map or navigation. In this code challenge, we used Map object to create each vertex (node) and create the edge between two nodes and their length or weight. This will make it easier to track the shortest path.**

## Approach & Efficiency
**Big(O) -> Time -> O(1)**
**Big(O) -> Space -> O(n)**

## API
- **_addNode_** add a node or vertex to the graph.
- **_addEdge_** add an edge or connection that will be linked between two nodes with a certain length or weight.
- **_getNeighbours_** is to get the node's neighbors where connected to it.
- **_getNodes_** is to get each node and its neighbors in the graph.
- **_size_** to get the size or numbers of nodes in the graph.
