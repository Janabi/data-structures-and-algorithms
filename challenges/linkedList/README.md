# Singly Linked List
**Creating a singly linked list.**

## Challenge
**Creating a singly linked list by inserting a each node by the user a using a constructor classes to build up these nodes inside the linked list.**

## Approach & Efficiency
***I used 'while' looping in order to retrieve throughout the constructed linkedlist.***
***Big(O) -> Time -> 2n***
***Big(O) -> Space -> n***

## API
- **insert(value)**
This method will let the user ti insert the value of node and this one will be inserted at the end and the user can do a chaining of insert methods.

- **includes(value)**
This method will return a boolean value to do a checking for the user if this certain value is exist in the linked list or not.

- **toString()**
This method will return a string of all values of linked list once its invoked.
