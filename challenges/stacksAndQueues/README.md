# Stacks and Queues
**Implementation of Stacks and Queues**

## Challenge
**The idea of creating a list of stacks and queues and also being able to delete the node at the beginning of the list and adding it in different position for the both stacks and queues.**

## Approach & Efficiency
**Push - Time -> n(1), Space -> n(n)**
**Pop - Time -> n(1), Space -> n(1)**
**Peek - Time -> n(1), Space -> n(1)**
**isEmpty - Time -> n(1), Space -> n(1)**
**enqueue - Time -> n(n), Space -> n(n)**
**dequeue - Time -> n(1), Space -> n(n)**
**peek - Time -> n(1), Space -> n(1)**
**isEmpty - Time -> n(1), Space -> n(1)**

## API
- **_Push_** push the node at the beginning of the list.
- **_Pop_** remove the first node in the list.
- **_Peek_** show the top of the list.
- **_isEmpty_** to check if the stack is empty or not.
- **_enqueue_** to push the node at the end of the list.
- **_dequeue_** remove the first node in the list.
***The rest will be the same as in the stack.***
